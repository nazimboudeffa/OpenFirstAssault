This is just a readme file until I find a way to work easy with 3D and GITHUB, btw am follwing the [Ancient Beast community](https://ancientbeast.com/) game developpement as they use to work with 3D assets

BTW, if you want to play an FPS cyberpunk like just give a try to [Ironsight](https://fr.ironsight.aeriagames.com/) THX

# Assets

You'll find all the legal assets on my 3D modding account on sketchfab
https://sketchfab.com/thefailtheory

The SWAT guy is from https://www.mixamo.com/

# Game

The original game is located on [steam](https://steamcommunity.com/app/369200)

You can take a look in this folder to find all the assets and files you need for the game
https://mega.nz/#F!MoUxQa6J!PuPWv5uULigINBGutEXfJA

You'll find the python scripts to unpack the assets of the steam game (use the v2 of the unpacker) in the same folder, just install the last python version, edit the script with the right paths and run

    #python gits_unpackerVERSION.py

There will always be two important ZIP files, OpenFirstAssault.zip (unreal 4.22 project) and WindowsNoEditor.zip (conataining an x64  build)

Actually when you launch the game just click on Play then if you want to quit Alt + F4 it's the key binding by default on unreal

# Fan kit

Am a big fan of the manga since its early publications in the 90s but here it's about the FPS Game

# Videos

The vids are not repertoried because we are hackers right :p 

I was following the game since its launch and modded it my way according to the community guidelines to not be banned or blacklisted so here are some videos of how it goes since it has been stoped
