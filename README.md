This is just a readme file until I find a way to work easy with 3D and GITHUB, btw am follwing the [Ancient Beast community](https://ancientbeast.com/) game developpement as they use to work with 3D assets

BTW, if you want to play an FPS cyberpunk like just give a try to [Ironsight](https://fr.ironsight.aeriagames.com/) THX

# Assets

You'll find all the legal assets on my 3D modding account on sketchfab

# Game

I will upload on Mega as soon as possible but you can come and take a look at the sate of my hacks

There will be two important ZIP files, OpenFirstAssault.zip (unreal 4.22 project) and WindowsNoEditor.zip (conataining a build)

When you launch the game just click on Play then if you want to quit Alt + F4 it's the key binding by default on unreal

# Fan kit

Am a big fan of the manga since its early publications in the 90s but here it's about the FPS Game
